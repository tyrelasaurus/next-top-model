```

## Next Steps for PFR Augmentation

### Recommended Approach
1. **Targeted Scraping** - Focus on playoff games and key matchups first
2. **Rate Limiting** - 3-5 seconds between requests to avoid overwhelming PFR
3. **Batch Processing** - Process 20-30 games per session
4. **Progress Tracking** - Save checkpoints to resume if interrupted
