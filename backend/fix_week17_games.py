## Summary
- Week 17 games fixed: {games_fixed}
- Issue: Week 17 games incorrectly marked as 'playoff' instead of 'regular'
- Impact: Resolves the missing 15 regular season games in 2022

## Root Cause
Week 17 is the final week of the NFL regular season, occurring in early January.
These games were incorrectly classified as playoff games instead of regular season games.

## Fix Applied
Changed game_type from 'playoff' to 'regular' for all Week 17 games in the 2022 season.

## Expected Results
- 2022 regular season should now have 272 games (complete)
- Database health score should improve to 95-100/100
- Data is now suitable for predictive modeling

## Verification
Run the audit again to verify the fix:
```bash
python audit_nfl_database.py
```

## Impact on Analysis
With complete regular season data, your database now supports:
- Accurate team performance analysis
- Reliable predictive modeling
- Complete season statistics
- Proper win/loss calculations
