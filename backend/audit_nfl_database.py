        report += "- Run critical games collector to gather missing statistics\n"
    
    if any("missing" in issue.lower() for issue in team_issues):

    if any("score" in issue.lower() for issue in game_issues):
        report += "- Update missing game scores\n"
    
    report += """
### Priority 2 (Important):
- Verify and correct any data quality issues
- Ensure all venue and attendance data is complete
- Add weather data for remaining games

### Priority 3 (Enhancement):
- Consider adding player-level statistics
- Implement data validation rules
- Set up automated data quality monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **Run the comprehensive builder**:
   ```bash
   python build_nfl_database.py --seasons 2022,2023,2024
   ```

2. **Address missing critical games**:
   ```bash
   python critical_games_collector.py
   ```

3. **Monitor data quality regularly**:
   ```bash
   python audit_nfl_database.py --detailed
   ```
