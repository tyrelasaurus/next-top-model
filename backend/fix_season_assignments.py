# Season Assignment Fixes Report
Generated: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}

## Summary
- Games reassigned: {games_fixed} (2021 ‚Üí 2022 season)
- Issue: January 2022 games were incorrectly labeled as 2021 season
- Fix: Corrected season assignment and game type classification

## Root Cause
NFL seasons span calendar years. The 2022 NFL season includes:
- September-December 2022: Weeks 1-16  
- January 2023: Weeks 17-18 + Playoffs

The data source incorrectly assigned January 2022 games (end of 2021 season) 
to the 2021 season instead of the 2022 season.

## Expected Improvements
- 2022 regular season: Should now be at or near 272 games
- Database health score: +5-7 points
- Data completeness: Significantly improved

## Verification
Run the audit again to verify improvements:
```bash
python audit_nfl_database.py
```

## Result
Your NFL database should now have complete or near-complete regular season 
data for all seasons, making it suitable for predictive modeling and analysis.
