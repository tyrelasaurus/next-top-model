### **What Was Consolidated**
1. **Merged Data**: Copied latest data from `sports_data.db` → `nfl_data.db`
2. **Updated Config**: Changed `.env` DATABASE_URL from `sports_data.db` to `nfl_data.db`
3. **Removed Duplicate**: Deleted `sports_data.db` after creating backup
4. **Verified Integrity**: All teams have GPS coordinates, all 4 seasons present

### **Database Schema Status**
- **Teams Table**: 32 NFL teams with complete metadata
  - ✅ GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
  - ✅ Stadium details (name, capacity)
  - ✅ Organization data (conference, division)
  - ✅ Historical data (founded year)

- **Games Table**: 1,289 games across 4 seasons
  - ✅ Core game data (scores, dates, teams)
  - ✅ Game classification (regular, playoffs)
  - ✅ Ready for PFR augmentation (weather, attendance)

### **Single Source of Truth Established**
- ✅ All application code uses `app.core.config.settings.DATABASE_URL`
- ✅ No hardcoded database paths in active scripts
- ✅ Consistent data model across entire application
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

### **Next Steps Available**
1. **PFR Augmentation**: Run `incremental_pfr_augmentation.py` to add weather/attendance
2. **API Development**: All endpoints will automatically use correct database
3. **Frontend Integration**: Single, clean data source for visualizations
4. **Data Export**: Consistent format for analytics and reporting

The NFL Data Aggregator now operates with a single, authoritative database containing complete team and game data, ready for enhancement and production use.
