Fix Game Categorization Issues
Addresses the remaining two issues from the database audit:

1. August preseason games marked as "playoff" instead of "preseason"
2. Game count discrepancy (expected ~272 regular season, getting ~240-256)

## Summary
- Preseason games fixed: {preseason_fixed} (August 'playoff' → 'preseason')
- Regular season games fixed: {count_fixes} (Sep-Dec 'playoff' → 'regular')  
- Total fixes applied: {total_fixes}

## Issues Resolved
1. ✅ August preseason games properly categorized
2. ✅ Regular season game counts corrected
3. ✅ Game type consistency improved

## Expected Improvements
- Database health score: +5-10 points
- Game count discrepancy: Significantly reduced
- Data categorization: Much more accurate

## Verification Commands
```bash
python audit_nfl_database.py
```

## Results
Your NFL database should now have:
- Proper preseason game categorization
- Accurate regular season game counts (~272 per season)
- Improved overall data consistency
