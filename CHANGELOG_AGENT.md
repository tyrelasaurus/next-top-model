### **Changelog: All Modifications**

Here is a complete log of the features and fixes implemented during this session.

*   **Build System:**
    *   Identified that the application is a Tauri app and uses `npm run tauri build` to create a release version.
    *   Successfully generated new application builds to package and deploy changes.

*   **Dashboard:**
    *   **Feature:** Added a dropdown menu to the "Season Insights" section to allow users to select a season (2021-2024).
    *   **Fix (Attempted):** Implemented logic to fetch and display season-specific data on the dashboard when a new season is selected. *Note: This feature is still buggy and does not update correctly.*

*   **Team Details Page:**
    *   **Fix:** Prevented the page from overpopulating with empty "Season Records" cards by filtering out seasons with no win/loss data. *Note: This is still not working as intended due to underlying data-loading issues.*
    *   **Feature:** The "Recent Game Performance" table now shows the opponent's name instead of a generic `game_id`.
    *   **Feature:** The "Recent Game Performance" table is now paginated, showing 10 games at a time with "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
    *   **Feature:** Game rows in the "Recent Game Performance" table are now clickable and navigate to the respective Game Details page.
    *   **Fix (Partially Successful):** The "Season Averages" section now attempts to calculate averages based on the games displayed. *Note: This is only partially working and is missing several key metrics.*

*   **Standings Page:**
    *   **Feature:** Team names in the standings table are now clickable links.
    *   **Feature:** Clicking a team name on the standings page navigates to the "Games" page and automatically filters to show that team's schedule for the selected season.

*   **Settings:**
    *   **Feature:** Added a new "Settings" page accessible from the main navigation bar.
    *   **Feature:** Implemented a temperature preference setting to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
    *   **Feature:** The weather temperature displayed on the Game Details page now respects the selected unit.

*   **Dashboard Season Insights Fix (Latest):**
    *   **Fix:** Resolved Season Insights dropdown not updating by implementing proper event listener management.
    *   **Fix:** Added fallback calculation of 2021 season stats from games data when team_season_stats is missing.
    *   **Fix:** Enhanced game type correction to properly classify 2021 Week 18 games as regular season instead of playoff.
    *   **Fix:** Implemented `calculateSeasonStatsFromGames()` function to generate missing team statistics.
    *   **Enhancement:** Added comprehensive logging for dashboard data loading and season changes.
